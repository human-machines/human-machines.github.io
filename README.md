# Human machines
A short essay.
<pre>
  ...the gardener, who was something of a philosopher, answered: "I have heard my teacher say: 
  'If a man uses machines, he carries on all the affairs of life like a machine; whoever 
  carries on his affairs like a machine gets a machine-like heart; and when anyone has a 
  machine-like heart in his breast, he loses true simplicity.'"

That is not true. :) He looses the infinite complexity of free will and his freedom of choice which are natural and may look like 'simplicity' for primitive minds.
